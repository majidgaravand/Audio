<h1>TAK Decoding Library</h1>
<p>
Decoding library for TAK, (T)om's lossless (A)udio (K)ompressor.</p>
<p>
Version: TAK_DECO_LIB.DLL V2.1.0 / 2011-01-08</p>
<p>

</p>


<h2>About</h2>
<p>
This library is needed by some applications created by other developers, who
used the TAK SDK to implement support for decoding and playback of TAK files.
Please read the applications documentation, to find out, if it needs this
library. For an update just copy the &quot;tak_deco_lib.dll&quot; file into
the appropriate directory of the application.</p>  
<p>
Neither my own TAK applications nor my Winamp plugin need this library!</p>


<h4>Links and contact information </h4>
<p>
My <a href="http://www.thbeck.de">homepage</a> provides up-to-date information
about <a href="http://www.thbeck.de/Tak/Tak.html">TAK</a>, sadly only in German
at present.</p>
<p>
If you want to contact me via e-mail, please keep in mind that I won't always
have the time to answer.</p>
<p>
I am regularly active in the "Lossless Audio Compression" forum at
<a href="http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/" title="Visit Hydrogen Audio">Hydrogenaudio</a>;
therefore it is a good place to get information about TAK or ask questions.</p>

<h1>History</h1>

<h3>V2.1.0 / 11-01-08</h3>
<p>
Nothing new, just compiled using the latest source code.</p>


<h3>V2.0.0 / 10-01-07</h3>
<p>
New features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for the new codec introduced with TAK 2.0.</li>
</ul>


<h3>V1.1.2 / 9-07-27</h3>
<p>
Improvements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Faster decoding and a smaller binary because of the optimizations in
      TAK 1.1.2.</li>
</ul>


<h3>V1.1.1 / 9-03-11</h3>
<p>
New Features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for MD5 verification.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Modifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This version will no longer use seek tables contained in files created
      with applications prior to TAK 1.1.1.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Improvements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Smaller binary because of the optimizations in TAK 1.1.1.</li>
</ul>


<h3>V1.1.0 / 9-01-04</h3>
<p>
New Features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for 192 Khz Audio.</li>
  <li>Seeking without seek table.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Improvements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Faster decoding because of the optimizations in TAK 1.1.0.</li>
</ul>


<h3>V1.0.7 / 8-03-11</h3>
<p>
Modifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Faster decoding because of the optimizations in TAK 1.0.4.</li>
</ul>


<h3>V1.0.6 / 7-12-14</h3>
<p>
Modifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The decoder had to be modified to guarantee error robustness (decoding
      through errors) for files created by pipe encoding with the -ihs 
	  (ignore header size) switch applied.</li>
</ul>


<h3>V1.0.5 / 7-11-05</h3>
<p>
New features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for frame sizes of 512, 1024 and 2048 samples which have been
      introduced with TAK V1.0.2.</li>
  <li>Support for the additional preset INSANE introduced with TAK V1.0.2.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The decoder is expected to process any (damaged) data without any
      problems. But i have found and corrected two cases, where the decoder
	  could crash. The chance for this was less than 1 : 1000 (for damaged
	  files only!).</li> 
  <li>In one place i used an invalid flag combination in a call of Windows' 
      VirtualFree().</li> 
</ul>
<p>
Interface Compatibility:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The decoder functions <i>tak_SSD_GetStreamInfo</i> and 
      <i>tak_SSD_GetEncoderInfo</i> may now return the new values for
	  the frame size (<i>Ttak_str_FrameSizeTypes</i>) and the encoder
	  preset/profile (<i>TtakPresets</i>) which have been introduced
	  with TAK 1.0.2.</li>
</ul>


<h3>V1.0.1 / 7-04-10</h3>
<p>
First stable release.</p>


<h3>V1.0.4 / 7-04-21</h3>
<p>
Fixes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fix of a minor multithreading issue, which could cause suboptimal
      performance and possibly crashes (in very rare cases). The fix itself is
	  not optimal performancewise; i will improve it when i have more time.</li>
</ul>


<h3>V1.0.3 / 7-04-21</h3>
<p>
Fixes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The memory manager was not thread safe. Multithreaded applications using
      more than one decoder instance simultaneously could crash. This was most
	  likely to happen with multi-core systems.</li>
</ul>


<h3>V1.0.2 / 7-04-14</h3>
<p>
Internal modifications and fixes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The APEv2 tag reading functions are a bit more tolerant when reading
      invalid tag headers not following the official APEv2 specification.</li>
  <li><i>tak_SSD_GetCurFrameBitRate()</i> reported wrong values when decoding high
      resolution audio.</li>
</ul>
