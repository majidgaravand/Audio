<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>
I am frequently active in the Lossless Audio Compression forum at
<a href="http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/" title="Visit Hydrogen Audio">Hydrogen Audio</a>;
a good place to ask questions regarding TAK.</p>
<p>
My homepage, <a href="http://www.thbeck.de/" title="Visit my homepage">www.thbeck.de</a>, 
contains some information about TAK, but unfortunately only in german.</p>
<p>
If you would like to contact me by email please be aware that i will not
always have time to answer.</p>


<h1>Installation</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Close Winamp (if running).</li>
  <li>Copy the file &quot;in_tak.dll&quot; into the Plugins folder of your
      Winamp installation.</li>
  <li>Start Winamp, open it's configuration dialog and associate the file
      extension &quot;tak&quot; with Winamp.</li>	  
</ul>


<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Very low cpu usage. Depending on the encoder preset my Pentium 3 with
      866 MHz decodes at a rate of 60 to 80 times faster than real time...</li>
  <li>Ultra fast seeking. I am not able to notice any delay on my old Pentium 3
      with 866 MHz.</li>
  <li>Maximum error tolerance. It should be possible to playback any file
      containing at least one intact block of about 2 seconds of audio data.</li>
  <li>Reading support for APEv2-tags located at the end of the file.</li>
  <li>Gapless playback.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some remarks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Seeking in damaged files will not always be possible.</li>
  <li>Any damaged part of the audio data will be muted (replaced with silence). 
      If only the last 2 seconds of an 60 minutes file are intact, the plugin
	  will first output 3598 seconds of silence. If you want to remove damaged
	  audio parts, decode the file with the TAK application and selcet the 
	  option &quot;Skip errors&quot;.</li>
  <li>I tested the plugin with Winamp 2.91, 5.34 and 5.5. When using v 5.34 
      and higher with the default skin, seeking seemed to be delayed. Most
	  probably this only regards to the position indicator, the playback
	  seems to start immediately. After switching to the classic skin, any
	  delay was gone.</li>
  <li>Because of my very old sound card, i could not test 24-bit playback. 
      Futhermore: Some visualization plugins don't support 24-bit data. It has
	  to be converted to 16 bit before sending it to those plugins. This has
	  not been implemented yet! It's very easy to do, but i don't want to
	  include code, which i am not able to test. I will soon buy a better 
	  soundcard.</li>
</ul>
