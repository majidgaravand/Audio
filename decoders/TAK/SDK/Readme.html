<h1>TAK SDK</h1>
<p>
Software Development Kit for TAK, (T)om's lossless (A)udio (K)ompressor.</p>
<p>
Version: TAK SDK 1.1.1, 2009-03-11</p>
<p>
Copyright 2007 by Thomas Becker, D-49080 Osnabrück.<br>
All rights reserved.
</p>


<h2>About</h2>
<p>
The SDK is intended to enable other developers to use TAK's technology in their
own applications. It consists of a Dynamic Link Library for Microsoft Windows
(DLL) as well as header files for Borland Delphi (Pascal) and C.</p>  
<p>
This version is limited to  decoding functions. Once it has stood the test of
time in practical use, an extended version with encoding functions will follow.</p>
<p>
The library is compatible to the TAK versions 1.0 to 2.1.0.</p>  


<h4>Files</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The &quot;Doc&quot; directory contains the documentation. The main file
      is &quot;Sdk.html&quot;. </li>
  <li>The &quot;Header&quot; directory contains the header files for the
      decoder library &quot;tak_deco_lib.dll&quot;.</li>
  <li>The &quot;Source&quot; directory contains parts of TAK's source code.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Links and contact information </h4>
<p>
My <a href="http://www.thbeck.de">homepage</a> provides up-to-date information
about <a href="http://www.thbeck.de/Tak/Tak.html">TAK</a>, sadly only in German
at present.</p>
<p>
If you want to contact me via e-mail, please keep in mind that I won't always
have the time to answer.</p>
<p>
I am regularly active in the "Lossless Audio Compression" forum at
<a href="http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/" title="Visit Hydrogen Audio">Hydrogenaudio</a>;
therefore it is a good place to get information about TAK or ask questions.</p>

  
<h4>Thanks to...</h4>
<p>
Many thanks for the energetic collaboration go to</p>
<ul>
  <li>Holger Stenger, who tested parts of the library, created a *.lib and gave
      good advice for interface improvements, and to</li>
  <li>Thomas Weiler (alias Silversight at Hydrogenaudio.org), who fortunately
      took pleasure in translating my often "longish" wording from German to
      English, and to</li>
  <li>Wieslaw Soltes (alias wisodev at Hydrogenaudio.org), who very quickly
      wrote the first file decoding application based upon the SDK to verify
	  it's function.</li>
</ul>

<h1>History</h1>

<h3>V1.1.1 / 9-03-11</h3>
<p>
Resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>German documentation removed.</li>
  <li>Source for TAK's container added.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Interface changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>New flag <i>tak_ssd_opt_CheckMd5</i> in the structure <i>TtakSSDOptions</i>
      to enable the MD5 check of the decoded audio data.</li>
</ul>


<h3>V1.1.0 / 8-12-21</h3>
<p>
Interface changes (Adaptions for TAK 1.1.0):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two constants for frame sizes (<i>Ttak_str_FrameSizeTypes</i>) removed:
      <i>tak_FrameSizeType_6144</i> and <i>tak_FrameSizeType_12288</i>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>V1.0.6 / 8-03-11</h3>
<p>
The library &quot;tak_deco_lib.dll&quot; is no longer part of the SDK.</p>


<h3>V1.0.5 / 7-12-05</h3>
<p>
Internal modifications of the bundled &quot;tak_deco_lib.dll&quot;
(now V1.0.6):</p>
<p>
New features to support TAK 1.0.3:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The decoder had to be modified to guarantee error robustness (decoding
      through errors) for files created by pipe encoding with the -ihs 
	  (ignore header size) switch applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Interface changes (Adaptions for TAK 1.0.3):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <i>tak_Preset_xxx</i>-constants have been removed from the include
      files. TAK's presets are now named purely numerical
	  (no more Turbo, Fast...).</li>
</ul>


<h3>V1.0.4 / 7-11-05</h3>
<p>
Internal modifications and fixes of the bundled &quot;tak_deco_lib.dll&quot;
(now V1.0.5):</p>
<p>
New features to support TAK 1.0.2:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for frame sizes of 512, 1024 and 2048 samples.</li>
  <li>Support for the additional preset INSANE.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The decoder is expected to process any (damaged) data without any
      problems. But i have found and corrected two cases, where the decoder
	  could crash. The chance for this was less than 1 : 1000 (for damaged
	  files only!).</li> 
  <li>In one place i used an invalid flag combination in a call of Windows' 
      VirtualFree().</li> 
</ul>
<p>
Interface changes (Adaptions for TAK 1.0.2):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added constants for the new frame sizes (<i>Ttak_str_FrameSizeTypes</i>):
      <i>tak_FrameSizeType_512</i> to <i>tak_FrameSizeType_12288</i>.</li>
  <li>Added constant for the new preset INSANE (<i>TtakPresets</i>):
      <i>tak_Preset_Insane</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Interface Compatibility:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The decoder functions <i>tak_SSD_GetStreamInfo</i> and 
      <i>tak_SSD_GetEncoderInfo</i> may now return the new values for
	  the frame size (<i>Ttak_str_FrameSizeTypes</i>) and the encoder
	  preset/profile (<i>TtakPresets</i>) which have been introduced
	  with TAK 1.0.2 (see &quot;Interface changes&quot;).</li>
</ul>


<h3>V1.0.3 / 7-04-28</h3>
<p>
Internal modifications and fixes of the bundled &quot;tak_deco_lib.dll&quot;
(now V1.0.4):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The memory manager was not thread safe. Multithreaded applications using
      more than one decoder instance simultaneously could crash. This was most
     likely to happen with multi-core systems.</li> 
  <li>Fix of a minor multithreading issue, which could cause suboptimal
      performance and possibly crashes (in very rare cases). The fix itself
      is not optimal performancewise; i will improve it when i have more time.</li> 
</ul>


<h3>V1.0.2 / 7-04-14</h3>
<p>
Internal modifications and fixes of the &quot;tak_deco_lib.dll&quot;
(V1.0.2):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The APEv2 tag reading functions are a bit more tolerant when reading
      invalid tag headers not following the official APEv2 specification.</li>
  <li><i>tak_SSD_GetCurFrameBitRate()</i> reported wrong values when decoding high
      resolution audio.</li>
</ul>


<h3>V1.0.1 / 7-04-10</h3>
<p>
First stable release.</p>
